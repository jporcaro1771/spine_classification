Description of features found in dataset used for this project


Pelvic incidence

angle between the line perpendicular to the sacral plate at its midpoint and the line connecting this point to the femoral heads axis


pelvic tilt

orientation of the pelvis in respect to the thighbones and the rest of the body. The pelvis can tilt towards the front, back, or either side of the body. Anterior pelvic tilt and posterior pelvic tilt are very common abnormalities in regard to the orientation of the pelvis


lumbar lordosis angle

angle that measures curve of lower back


sacral slope

angle between the sacral plate and a horizontal line. A vertical sacrum is described by a low value of sacral slope, a horizontal sacrum by a high value of sacral slope


pelvic radius

degree spondylolisthesis

Spondylolisthesis is a slipping of vertebra that occurs, in most cases, at the base of the spine. Spondylolysis, which is a defect or fracture of one or both wing-shaped parts of a vertebra, can result in vertebrae slipping backward, forward, or over a bone below.
